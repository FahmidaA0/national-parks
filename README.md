# 🌳 Planet Over Profit: NYC Parks Funding Disparities

*A data visualization project exposing inequality in New York City park maintenance budgets*

## 🔍 Problem Statement
New York City's parks suffer from severe funding inequality:
- **Wealthy neighborhoods** benefit from private conservancies (e.g., Central Park's $24M private funding)
- **Low-income areas** rely on shrinking public budgets (e.g., Canarsie Park's $62K total budget)
- 80% of private park funding goes to just 5% of parks
